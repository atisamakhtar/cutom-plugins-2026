### 2️⃣ Trip Type Filter Bug - DIAGNOSED & DOCUMENTED ✅

**Issue:**
- Total bookings: 53
- One Way filter: 27
- Round Trip filter: 23
- **Missing:** 3 records

**Root Cause:**
The 3 missing records have **malformed trip_type values** (NULL, empty string, or invalid data).

**Filter Code Status:** ✅ **CORRECT - No code changes needed**

**Solution:** Run this SQL query to fix the data:

```sql
UPDATE wp_fg_bookings
SET trip_type = 'one_way'
WHERE trip_type IS NULL 
   OR trip_type = '' 
   OR trip_type NOT IN ('one_way', 'round_trip');
```

**Diagnostic Query** (check current distribution):
```sql
SELECT trip_type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM wp_fg_bookings 
GROUP BY trip_type;
```

**Files Modified:**
- `includes/class-fgbw-admin.php` - Added diagnostic documentation

---

### 3️⃣ Hide Vehicle Column - COMPLETE ✅

**Changes:**
- ✅ **Removed** Vehicle column from WordPress admin bookings table
- ✅ **Removed** Vehicle column from CSV export
- ✅ **Preserved** backend logic - vehicle data still stored in database
- ✅ Vehicle column can be restored by uncommenting code if needed

**Files Modified:**
- `includes/class-fgbw-admin.php` - Hidden UI column (line ~386, ~430, ~643)

---

### 4️⃣ Route & CSV Export with ALL Stops - COMPLETE ✅

**Previous Behavior:**
- CSV showed: `Pickup From → Drop-Off To`
- **Missing:** Intermediate stops

**New Behavior:**
- CSV shows: `A → Stop 1 → Stop 2 → Stop 3 → B` (complete route)
- **ALL stops** included in both pickup and return routes
- Same format used in admin UI

**CSV Columns Changed:**
```
Before:
- Pickup From | Drop-Off To | Return From | Return To

After:
- Pickup Route (Full) | Pickup DateTime | Return Route (Full) | Return DateTime
```

**Files Modified:**
- `includes/class-fgbw-admin.php` - CSV export logic updated

---

### 5️⃣ Email Template Placeholders - COMPLETE ✅

**New Placeholders Added:**
- `{first_name}` - Customer first name (extracted from full name)
- `{last_name}` - Customer last name (extracted from full name)
- `{email}` - Customer email address
- `{phone}` - Customer phone number (with country code)

**All Available Placeholders:**
```
{booking_id}       - Booking ID number
{name}             - Full customer name
{first_name}       - First name only (NEW)
{last_name}        - Last name only (NEW)
{email}            - Email address (NEW)
{phone}            - Phone number (NEW)
{trip_type}        - one_way or round_trip
{order_type}       - airport_pickup, airport_dropoff, etc.
{vehicle}          - sedan, suv, etc.
{passenger_count}  - Number of passengers
{pickup_summary}   - Full pickup details (date, time, locations, stops)
{return_summary}   - Full return details (only for round trips)
```

**Usage Example:**
```html
<h2>Booking Confirmed: #{booking_id}</h2>
<p>Dear {first_name} {last_name},</p>
<p>We have received your booking request.</p>
<p><strong>Contact:</strong> {email} | {phone}</p>
```

**Files Modified:**
- `includes/class-fgbw-email.php` - Placeholder extraction logic
- `includes/class-fgbw-admin.php` - Settings page documentation

---

### 6️⃣ Disable Past Date Booking - COMPLETE ✅

**Frontend Protection:**
- ✅ Date/time picker `min` attribute set to current date/time
- ✅ Users cannot select past dates in calendar UI

**Backend Validation:**
- ✅ Server-side check: Rejects bookings with pickup/return in the past
- ✅ Returns error: "Pickup time cannot be in the past"

**Files Modified:**
- `assets/js/booking-wizard.js` - Date picker min constraint
- `includes/class-fgbw-ajax.php` - Backend date validation

## ⚠️ Action Required: Fix Trip Type Data

Run this SQL query in phpMyAdmin to fix the 3 malformed records:

```sql
UPDATE wp_fg_bookings
SET trip_type = 'one_way'
WHERE trip_type IS NULL 
   OR trip_type = '' 
   OR trip_type NOT IN ('one_way', 'round_trip');
```

After running this query:
- One Way + Round Trip counts will equal Total bookings
- Filters will work correctly

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test booking with different countries (US, UK, India, etc.)
- [ ] Verify phone validation shows correct error messages
- [ ] Try to select a past date - should be blocked
- [ ] Submit booking - check both customer and admin emails
- [ ] Verify new placeholders ({email}, {phone}, {first_name}, {last_name}) work
- [ ] Export CSV - verify vehicle column is hidden
- [ ] Export CSV - verify all stops appear in route
- [ ] Check trip type filters after running SQL fix
- [ ] Verify vehicle data still exists in database (backend preserved)
